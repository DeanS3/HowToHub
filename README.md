LAST UPADATED: MARCH 26, 2013

I made the site available using github pages(http://deans3.github.com/HowToHub/index.html).
It should ask you to log in using your facebook account through a modal popup on the home page.

WELCOME TO HOW TO HUB!!!

The site was built to help DO IT YOURSELFERS showcase their projects, admire others works, and find new projects to tackle.
I want users to have a YouTube account already to encourage users to upload videos of their projects.

1. Log in and grant How To Hub permission through the Oauth 2 Authentication.
2. Set up you profile.(Name, Accomplishments, Link to videos)
3. Search the site and Show off your projects!
