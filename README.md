LAST UPADATED: MARCH 27, 2013

I made the site available using github pages(http://deans3.github.com/HowToHub/index.html).
It should ask you to log in using your facebook account through a modal popup on the home page.  Right now the enter
site button is disabled, I am working on code that would check to see if a user is logged in and if they are
it would enable the button.  The other pages are accessible through gh-pages by typing their name in place of
index(user, form, etc).

Right now there is no functionality on the user page outside of the updating list of HOW TO videos from youtube 
in the side bar.  I am looking to add the ability to upload images and have people comment below them.

By friday there should be options to send email to join up for mailing list and if I can figure it out then the 
ability to like and share the uploaded images to facebook will be added too.
